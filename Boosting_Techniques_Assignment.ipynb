    "Q1. What is Boosting in Machine Learning? Explain how it improves weak learners?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Boosting is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple weak learners to form a strong learner. Models are trained sequentially, where each new model focuses more on the errors made by previous models. This improves performance by reducing bias and improving predictive accuracy."

    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "AdaBoost adjusts the weights of misclassified samples and trains models sequentially. Gradient Boosting trains models sequentially by optimizing a loss function using gradient descent."
